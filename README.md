# üíª Device Setup

This document outlines the setup process for my development and productivity environment across **macOS**, **Linux**, and **Windows**. It includes package installations, system configurations, and essential tools I use across devices.

## üõ†Ô∏è macOS Setup

### 1. Install Homebrew

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

After installation, configure the environment (example for `zsh`):

```bash
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

### 2. Install Packages with Homebrew

Use the following syntax:

```bash
brew install <formula_name>         # For CLI tools
brew install --cask <cask_name>     # For GUI applications
```

### ‚úÖ Homebrew Formulae (CLI Tools)

```bash
brew install nvm    # Node Version Manager ‚Äì manage multiple Node.js versions

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è LibreWolf Special Note

LibreWolf is marked as "broken" on MacOS because [LibreWolf developers choose not to pay for an Apple Developer certificate](https://librewolf.net/docs/faq#why-is-librewolf-marked-as-broken). Use the `--no-quarantine` flag when installing.
